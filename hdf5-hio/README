HDF5 HIO plugin Readme
==========

Last updated 2016-07-20

Building
--------

This plugin is built with the main HIO build. See the README
in the root of the extracted tarball. The options to pass to configure
are: --with-hdf5=path_to_hdf5 --with-hdf5-src=path_to_hdf5_src . The source
is needed to build this plugin.

There are also docs included that will be build with make docs from the root
directory.

Testing
-------

There is a test in the test subdirectory. Run it with: ./hdf5_hio_test. If
HIO is built with MPI, the test will also use MPI.
