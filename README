HIO Readme
==========

Last updated 2016-02-24

See file NEWS for a description of changes to hio.


Building
--------

HIO builds via a standard autoconf/automake build.  So, to build:

1) Untar
2) cd to root of tarball
3) module load needed compiler or MPI environment 
4) ./configure
5) make 

Additional generally useful make targets include clean and docs.  make docs
will build the HIO API document, but it requires doxygen and various latex
packages to run, so you may prefer to use the document distributed in file
design/libhio_api.pdf.

Our target build environments include gcc with OpenMPI on Mac OSX for unit
test and gcc, Intel and Cray compilers on LANL Cray systems and TOSS clusters
with OpenMPI or Cray MPI.  

Included with HIO is a build script named hiobuild.  It will perform all of
the above steps in one invocation.  The HIO development team uses it to launch
builds on remote systems.  You may find it useful; a typical invocation might 
look like:

./hiobuild -c -s PrgEnv-intel PrgEnv-gnu

hiobuild will also create a small script named hiobuild.modules.bash that
can be sourced to recreate the module environment used for build.


Testing
-------

HIO's tests are in the tests subdirectory.  There is a simple API test named
test01 which can also serve as a coding example.  Additionally, other tests
are named run02, run03, etc.  Theses tests are able to run in a variety of
environments:

1) On Mac OSX for unit testing
2) On a non-DataWarp cluster in interactive or batch mode
3) On one of the Trinity systems with DataWarp in interactive or batch mode

run02 and run03 are N-N and N-1 tests (respectively). Options help can be
displayed by invoking with a -h option.  These tests use a common script 
named run_setup to process options and establish the testing environment.
They invoke hio using a program named xexec which is driven by command strings
contained in the runxx test scripts.

A typical usage to submit a test DataWarp batch job on buffy might look like:

cd <tarball>/tests
./run02 -s m -r 32 -n 2 -b 

Options used:
  -s m    ---> Size medium (200 MB per rank)
  -r 32   ---> Use 32 ranks
  -n 2    ---> Use 2 nodes
  -b      ---> Submit a batch job  

The runxx tests will use the hiobuild.modules.bash files saved by hiobuild
(if available) to reestablish the same module environment used at build
time.

A multi-job submission script to facilitate running a large number of tests
with one command  is available.  A typical usage for a fairly thorough test
on a large system like Trinity might look like:

run_combo -t ./run02 ./run03 ./run12 -s x y z -n 32 64 128 256 512 1024 -p 32 -b

This will submit 54 jobs (3 x 3 x 6) with all combinations of the specified
tests and parameters.  The job scripts and output will be in the tests/run
subdirectory.


Step by step procedure for building and running HIO tests on Trinity
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure is accurate as of 2016-02-24 with HIO.1.2.0.3.

1) Get the distribution tarball libhio-1.2.0.1.tar.gz from oine of the following:
   a) tr-login1:~cornell/hio/libhio-1.2.0.1.tar.gz
   b) yellow /usr/projects/hio/user/rel/libhio-1.2.0.1.tar.gz
   c) By request from Cornell Wright - cornell@lanl.gov

2) Untar

3) cd <dir>/libhio-1.2       ( <dir> is where you untarred HIO )

4) ./hiobuild -cf -s PrgEnv-cray,PrgEnv-gnu -l craype-haswell 

   At the end of the build you will see:

   nid00070 ====[HIOBUILD_RESULT_START]===()===========================================
   nid00070 buildhio : Checking /cray_home/cornell/libhio/libhio-1.2/hiobuild.out for build problems
   41:configure: WARNING: using cross tools not prefixed with host triplet
   268:Warning:
   nid00070 buildhio : Checking for build target files
   nid00070 buildhio : Build errors found, see above.
   nid00070 ====[HIOBUILD_RESULT_END]===()=============================================

   Ideally, the two warning messages would not be present, but at the moment, they can be ignored.

5) cd tests

6) ./run_combo -t ./run02 ./run03 ./run12 ./run20 -s z y x -n 1024 512 256 128 64 32 16 -p 32 -b

   This will create 84 job scripts in the libhio-1.2/tests/run directory and submit the jobs.
   Msub messages are in the cooresponding .jobid files in the same directory. Job output is
   directed to corresponding .out files.  The number and mix of jobs is controlled by the
   parameters. Issue run_combo -h for more information.

7) After the jobs complete, issue the following:

   grep -c "RESULT: SUCCESS" run/*.out

   If all jobs ran OK, grep should show 84 files with a count of 1.  Like this:

   cornell@tr-login1:~/pgm/hio/tr-gnu/libhio-1.2/tests> grep -c "RESULT: SUCCESS" run/*.out
   run/job.20160108.080917.out:1
   run/job.20160108.080927.out:1
   run/job.20160108.080936.out:1
   run/job.20160108.081422.out:1
     . . . .
   run/job.20160108.082133.out:1
   run/job.20160108.082141.out:1

   Investigate any missing job output or counts of 0.

8) Resources for better understanding and/or modifying these procedures:

   libhio-1.2/README
   libhio-1.2/hiobuild -h
   libhio-1.2/tests/run_combo -h
   libhio-1.2/tests/run_setup -h
   libhio-1.2/tests/run02, run03, run12, run20
   libhio-1.2/tests/xexec -h
   libhio-1.2/design/libhio_api.pdf

9) Alternate command suitible for Gadget:

   ./run_combo -t ./run02 ./run03 ./run12 ./run20 -s t s m l -n 1 2 4 1 2 4 -p 32 -b
