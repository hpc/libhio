HIO NEWS

Last updated 2018-03-29

Release hio.1.4.1.1-rc1

This is a bugfix release. The following bugs have been fixed:

 - #36: Excessive error messages on filesystem query failure. This
    issue was fixed by updating the code to print out the failure only
    from rank 0.

 - #37: Errors when using persistent DataWarp reservation. Fixed by
    updating the data root selection code in builtin-datawarp.c.

Release hio.1.4.1.0

This is a new release that adds support for importing files not written by
libhio. This support can be enabled by setting the posix_simple_filename
and posix_simple_import. This support is not enabled by default. This
release additionally adds support for a new directory layout. The new
layout creates a single directory in the data root instead of creating
a hierarchical directory structure. This new support can be enabled by
setting dataset_posix_directory_mode=single. The default directory
structure has not changed but may change in the 1.5.0 release.

Release hio.1.4.0.0

Fixes for error handling in buffered (stdio) paths. Fixes to a couple of
high-verbosity debug messages. Build fixes.


Release hio.1.4.0.0-rc3

Support for pwrite and pread added.  API hio_print_vars added. basic file mode
now enables small write buffering.  Miscellaneous testing and documentation
enhancements.  This is expected to be the last rc before 1.4.0.0.


Release hio.1.4.0.0-rc2

Bug fix related to writes larger than 4GiB, improved performance statistics,
Addition of a job cancellation test program, miscellaneous test enhancements.
Additions to README.datawarp based on user experiences.


Release hio.1.4.0.0-rc1

This release brings further optimizations to libhio. There are now three file
modes that can be used: basic, file_per_node, and strided. No change was made
to basic mode but optimized mode was split into two. The first writes all
element data to a single file associated with all processes on the node. The
second writes data blocks for each element across multiple files. file_per_node
is valid for both unique and shared datasets but strided mode is only valid for
shared datasets. The default mode for shared datasets is has been changed from
basic to strided. No change was made to the default file mode for unique
datasets.


Release hio.1.3.0.5

This release adds additional performance instrumentation and diagnostic
messages on test failure.  A new action "dbuf" is added to xexec to specify the
write data pattern used for data compare. The test cases have been updated to
specify the pattern previously used by default. 


Release hio.1.3.0.4

Multiple test enhancements, better messages on certain failures, job specific
DataWarp information logged.


Release hio.1.3.0.3

Some small test improvements, a fix for partial read and write handling and
improved diagnostic and debug messages related to dw_stage_directory_out calls.
Additionally, an early version of an HDF5 plugin has been added. It is untested
and is not included in the distribution tarball.

Release hio.1.3.0.2

A few minor updates, all related to testing.


Release hio.1.3.0.1

Fixes for getting incorrect stripe count, some logging related improvements and
performance enhancements.  runxx and run_combo tests now support -k (processor
type) and -u (debugger) options. 


Release hio.1.3.0.0

This is the first open source relase of HIO.  It is now available on github at
https://github.com/hpc/libhio .  We're still working out our release
procedures, so for now the release is designated by the tag hio.1.3.0.0.

Changes since the rc version are primarily fixes and performance enhancements
to optimised mode.  Additionally, there are a number of minor test fixes and
functional enhancements.


Release hio.1.3.0.0-rc1:

Updated external interface to allow for configuration of datasets before open.
Two existing functions have been modified and two new functions have been
added. The new functions are hio_dataset_alloc and hio_dataset_free which take
the same arguments as the old hio_dataset_open and hio_dataset_close
respectively. hio_dataset_open and hio_dataset_close now only take a
hio_dataset_t handle. After a dataset has been allocated using
hio_dataset_alloc it can be configured using hio_config_set_value. A new
function hio_object_get_name() has been added to get the name associated with a
context, dataset, or element handle.  The example in the API document has not
yet been updated.  See tests/test01.c for a working example of the modified
API.  Numerous minor documentation and test fixes and enhancements.

Release hio.1.2.0.4:

Make hio.h C89 compliant.  Minor build and test updates.


Release hio.1.2.0.3:

Minor documentation and test fixes and enhancements.


Release hio.1.2.0.2:

Updated statistics reported when HIO_print_statistics is set to report the
overall (dataset open -> close) read/write speed and instantaneous read/write
speed. The speed is now only reported by the first rank in the context. Removed
error messages when 0-byte dataset manifests are encountered. Fixed bugs when
using datawarp including deleting the wrong dataset ID after staging a new
dataset ID. Added new variables to expose the RAID level and filesystem type
backing a dataset. New manifests are now written ending in a newline instead of
a NULL character. This does not break backwards compatibility with 1.2.x.x
releases.  Added staging test run20.  Added Trinity step-by-step build and run
procedure to README.  Minor build and test improvements.


Release hio.1.2.0.1:

Test scripts enhanced with new, larger size options y and z. Multi-test script
run_combo added.  Added -m <msub_args> option. Also, additional minor build and
testcase fixes.


Release hio.1.2.0.0:

Switched from XML to JSON format for the manifest file.  This means that hio
datasets created with previous releases cannot be read with this version. We
don't expect to be this casual about incompatible changes in the future, but
since at the moment, hio is only being used for development and testing
activities an exception seems reasonable.

Minor bug fixes, diagnostic, testing and build improvements.
